# Wine-Review-EDA
In this Project I have created a baseline analysis to understand some characteristics about the different wines based on the regions and different wineries.

## Context
I'll start exploring the data to find for interesting informations about the wine quality based on the sommeliers comments. 

## I will try answer a batch of questions, like:

- Have an Provinces the same number of wines? <br>
- Whats the distribuition of Price and Points by Province? <br>
- Whats the country distribuition<br>
- The taster's have the same number of votings? <br>
- What's the distribuition of Points and Prices by taster's name?   <br>
- Taking a look on the word clouds.    <br>
